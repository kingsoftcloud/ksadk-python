"""Independent callback registry to avoid __main__ / canonical module double-instance.

When the MCP server is launched via ``python -m ksadk.skills.mcp_server.server``,
Python creates two module instances: ``__main__`` (entry point) and the
canonical ``ksadk.skills.mcp_server.server``.  A module-level list in
``server.py`` would exist in both copies, and callbacks registered from the
canonical import would never be seen by the background thread running in
``__main__``.

This module is always imported as ``ksadk.skills.mcp_server._registry``
(no ``__main__`` ambiguity), so both code paths share the same list.
